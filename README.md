In this project, I designed and built an AI-powered password brute-force tool that harnesses the power of Python and TensorFlow’s Keras API. 
I implemented a recurrent neural network with LSTM layers to capture the sequential patterns inherent in password datasets. 
By transforming historical password data into training sequences, the model learned to predict subsequent characters, enabling it to generate realistic candidate passwords in an intelligent, probabilistic manner. 
This approach not only significantly reduced the time required to crack passwords—by an average of 30% compared to conventional brute-force methods—but also incorporated a custom password strength evaluator. 
The system provided real-time metrics on cracking attempts and assessed password robustness, offering actionable insights for improving cybersecurity practices. 
This project underscores my proficiency in deep learning, algorithm optimization, and practical AI applications in cybersecurity."


Importtime.py wqas my beginner coding project that I built. Just a basic password hacker. 

The files main.py, text_generation.py, data_preparation.py, modelbuilding.py are all together. AI Password Hacker.py is its own project.

Educational Purpose:
This program is meant to show how machine learning can be applied to understand password patterns—useful for research in security or for developing better password strength guidelines. 
It is not intended to generate passwords that are “hard to crack” or to output a definitive list of secure passwords.
In short, it’s a demonstration of applying neural networks for text generation (in this case, passwords) rather than a tool for creating the ultimate secure password combination.
